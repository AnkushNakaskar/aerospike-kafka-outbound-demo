==> Caveats
To start kafka now and restart at login:
  brew services start kafka
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties

Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).

==> Caveats
To start kafka now and restart at login:
  brew services start kafka
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties

Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
